# PostgreSQL
- Installation of PostgreSQL on local PC is needed 
- Create a database on the SQL server with name "todoro", otherwise edit the name in the config.json file 
- Create a username and password for the db server, add the username and password to the config file, alternatively, edit the "pg_hba.conf" file to enable server to trust the username so no password needs to be supplied
